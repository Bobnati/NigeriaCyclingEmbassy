        <p>"HYBRID/GRAVEL BIKES: Best of both worlds?</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Imagine you're a biking enthusiast torn between a road bike and an MTB. Well, fret not! 
            The gravel bike comes to the rescue, cutting unnecessary costs like a pro. 
            Why buy two separate bikes when you can have the best of both worlds in a single ride?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Picture the taste of a secret soup recipe combined with the heartwarming nostalgia of your grandma's comforting dish.
            It's like culinary magic, right? Well, guess what? Biking has its own version of this enchantment too! 
            Say hello to the hybrid/gravel bike!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Think of these bikes as a combination of a road bike and a mountain bike...for the purpose of creating the ultimate biking masterpiece.
            It's like having the speed of a road bike and the rugged strength of a mountain bike - in one sleek ride.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Masters OF Versatility</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Gravel Bikes aren't picky. They can make you feel at home both on the smooth main roads and in off-road conditions. 
            No terrain is off-limits for the gravel bike. You can call them the chameleon of the biking world, adapting to any surroundings
            with a little more adjustments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>For example, gravel bikes have more tire clearance or tire space for their frames, so you can install bigger tires if you ride
            more in off-road conditions. The flexibility of the gravel bike is unmatched!</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Cons of Gravel Bikes</p>
            
            <p>USUALLY HEAVIER</p>
            
            <p>Gravel bikes usually come with a little extra weight compared to their road counterparts.
            The possibilities of flexibility mean that they have to be fitted with very rigid frames such as steel or aluminum,
            which adds to the weight of the bike.</p>
            
            <p>Reduced Specialization</p>
            <p>While they've got the flexibility to be pretty much anything a bike can be,
            gravel bikes still bow to the superior speed of road bikes and the immense comfortability and hill climbing capabilities that
            mountain bikes have. If you know the conditions you will be doing most of your riding in, it is much better to go for
            a roadie or a mountain bike from the start.</p>
